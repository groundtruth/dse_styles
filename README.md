# Groundtruth Public Styles

Stylesheets for [Victorian geospatial data](http://www.data.vic.gov.au/category/Spatial+Data)
layers used at Groundtruth.

These are written in [GeoServer CSS](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/css/index.html)
but this repository tracks the styles in both CSS and the SLD generated from them.

## Getting started

Before getting started you'll need to
[install the GeoServer CSS Plugin](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/css/install.html),
for example, from [here](http://gridlock.opengeo.org/geoserver/master/community-latest/).

Next, get the code:

    git clone git@github.com:groundtruth/gt_public_styles.git && cd gt_public_styles

## CSS regeneration workflow

Copy the `config.sh.eg` file to `config.sh` and adjust it for your GeoServer installation
and `rsync` destination.

To process the CSS files and synchronise the resulting SLD files to a server using `rsync`,
run:

    ./bin/process.sh

On UNIX this can be triggered automatically when files under `./css/` change as follows:

    bundle install
    ./bin/watch.sh

To just synchronise the SLD files to the sever (useful when manually tweaking the SLDs
for troubleshooting), run:

    ./bin/sync.sh

## Preview page

See the `preview/` directory for details.

## Rewrapping and stylesheet/layer naming conventions

See `bin/rewrap.rb`.

## CSS limitations

These are issues we discovered in the CSS module. They were fixed, but have not necessarily
been included in the public release builds yet:

* [CSS with solid font-fill generating SLD with empty GraphicFill](https://github.com/dwins/geoscript.scala/issues/25)
* [Long comments causing stack overflow](https://github.com/dwins/geoscript.scala/issues/27)

Other limitations of CSS we faced included:

* Can't specify fill properties in more than three scales (e.g. rules like `[@scale<17061]:fill{ ... }`).
* No `-drop-shadow` (can't create an offset of a polygon).
* No `-label-anchor`.
* Padding (minimum space around an item in which items of same time are not repeated)
  can't be set around marks (only labels).

## CSS tricks

* Use a separate layer for a road underlay (so that individual road segments don't have
  stroke borders that overlap other segments' stroke bodies).
* Use a label of '.' (or maybe '') with a shield to get an effect similar to marks with padding.
